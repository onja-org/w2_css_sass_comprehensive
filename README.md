# 🎨 CSS/SCSS Comprehensive Lab
## Week 2: Design System Documentation Platform

This repository contains a comprehensive SCSS lab focused on building professional form components using modern CSS organization, responsive design principles, and BEM methodology.

## 📚 Lab Overview

**🎯 Goal:** Build professional form components using SCSS organization, responsive design, and BEM methodology

**⏱️ Duration:** 1.5 - 2 hours

**📚 Prerequisites:** SCSS basics (variables, nesting, mixins), CSS fundamentals, HTML semantics

### 🌟 The Mission

Students take on the role of a front-end developer at **DesignDocs**, a startup that helps design teams document their component libraries. The task is to transform unstyled HTML form components into a polished, responsive design system that other developers will use as a reference.
